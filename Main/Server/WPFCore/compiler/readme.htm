	<h3>About the content of this folder</h3>
	<p>This folder of the solution contains the binaries of LayerD compilers.</p>
	<p>In this sample application LayerD compilers are used for .NET platform when the server compiles 
        Infrastructure Services for stores or the mall, also it is used for the compilation of 
	assemblies when building Custom Services of stores/mall.</p>
        <p>To generate .NET assemblies from high level services model we use custom DSL 
            implemented with LayerD as compiler extensions - &quot;classfactorys&quot; on the 
            terminology of LayerD framework. The used extensions are installed on the 
            distributed compiler under &quot;factorieslib&quot; folder.</p>
	<p>LayerD project is a framework with modular extensible compiler for multiple platforms - including .NET - and it is open source.</p>
	<p>For more information on LayerD visit <a href="http://layerd.net">http://layerd.net</a>.</p>
	<p>For license information of these compilers read <a href="license.txt">license.txt</a>.</p>
